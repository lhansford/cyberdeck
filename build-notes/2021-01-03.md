# Setting up a new Raspberry Pi 4

I picked up a Rasberry Pi 4 (8GB memory) to start off my Cyberdeck today. My first step is going
to be to get it running with Raspberry Pi OS and maybe set a little bit of software stuff up.

The Raspbian name has been dropped since I last used an RPi. It's now called Raspberry Pi OS and
they've got a nice app for loading up an SD Card with it. I had an old 16GB SD card from another
project so I'm going to use that for now. Potentially in the future I might try using some sort of
USB HD, but I'm unsure at the moment how much space I'll need.

Already I'm keenly aware that cable management is going to be a big part of this project!

I got it working eventually (after failing to plug the HDMI cable in correctly on both ends - that
took a while to figure out). I didn't tinker much with the software, just removed a few pre-installed
apps. I'm thinking I might opt for Ubuntu, Arch or Legacy as the OS down the road, but for now this'll
do the trick.
